# Gene expression data for brain region classification

**Introduction**

Human brain organoids are powerful tools, not only to study normal brain development, but 
also to gain knowledge on neurological diseases. However, a key aspect for these studies is 
the precise determination of cellular maturity and regional identity. Brain region identification 
based solely on a few expression markers, although useful and generally inexpensive, does
not fully capture the complete range of gene expression patterns that may be presented by
the organoids In fact, distinct differentiation trajectories across protocols have been identified [1], 
posing the need to a more efficient and complete characterization of developing organoids.
Machine learning approaches have already been applied to study different aspects of brain 
organoids culture and development [2]. In the future, ML models may be used to rapidly classify 
organoids into brain regions and maturity stages. In this work a primary study on brain region classification will be done using a transcriptomic 
data from adult brain samples.
